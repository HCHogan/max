# Repository instructions

This is the Rust rewrite of Max, on `main` since 2026-10-31. The design lives in
`docs/rust-rewrite.md` and is updated as decisions are made. The Haskell
version, with its docs and assets, is at tag `haskell-base`; bring a file
back with `git restore --source=haskell-base -- <path>` when the feature
that needs it is being built.

## Before every commit

In the dev shell (`nix develop --impure`, or direnv), from the repository
root:

- `cargo fmt --check`
- `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`
- `cargo nextest run`

Do not commit if any of them fails. `nix flake check --impure` runs these
and the rest of CI's checks: cargo-deny, cargo-audit, cargo-machete,
max-core's dependency allow list, max-core built alone, and the package.

The dev shell's Postgres (port 5434, database `max`, role `max`) runs under
`devenv up`, the dev shell's own: a `devenv` installed elsewhere reads some
other project. Without a terminal, start it with `PC_TUI_ENABLED=0 devenv up`.

## Queries

max-db's queries are checked at compile time: against the dev database in
the dev shell, and against `crates/max-db/.sqlx` in the Nix build, which has
no database. After changing a query or a migration, run
`scripts/prepare-queries` (it resets the dev database) and commit
`crates/max-db/.sqlx`. To build without the database running, set
`SQLX_OFFLINE=true`.

## Public repository

The repository is public. Use made-up QQ numbers, openids, group ids and
chat handles in tests, docs and examples; real ones live only in sops.
The QQ bot's AppID and secret are in the gitignored `.env` for local
runs; never print or commit them.
